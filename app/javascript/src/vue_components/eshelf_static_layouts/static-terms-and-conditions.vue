          </h4>

              6.1. All Products must be paid for in full through the Site before the
              Buyer can receive the Product. The price on the Site is the price that the
              Buyer pays, but the Retailer agrees that the sum they receive is equal to
              the price less our Commission. In order to manage the process of any
              refunds under this Condition 6, the Retailer agrees that we will retain the
              price paid by the Buyer until the 14 day cancellation period has expired.
              After that date, provided that the Buyer has not returned the Product, we
              shall pay to the Retailer the sums due.
          </p>
          <p>
              6.2 The payment processing services on the Site are provided Stripe and are

              processing services, you agree to provide us with accurate and complete
              information, and you authorise us to share such information and transaction
              information related to your use of the payment processing services provided
              by Stripe.
          </p>
          <p>
              6.3 Once payment has been made by a Buyer, the Retailer must promptly
              process the order and make the Product available for shipping.
          </p>
          <p>
              6.4 A Buyer may cancel the contract for the purchase of Products ordered
              through the Site. A Buyer must activate the return by contacting our
              customer service by email (customerservice@eshelf.co.uk) within 14 days
              from the date the Buyer receives the Products, clearly stating the
              following: your name, geographical address, your phone number, email
              address and full details of the order you wish to cancel. The Retailer must
              promptly notify us via mail (boutiques@eshelf.co.uk) the receipt of the
              return. The Customer will receive the refund through the same payment
              mechanism they used to pay for the Products.
          </p>
          <p>
              6.5 If a Buyer does cancel a contract, the Buyer must take reasonable care
              of the Products whilst they are in its possession, including by storing
              them in accordance with the Retailer’s instructions. The Buyer must send
              the Goods to the Retailer’s outlet at the address details provided by the
              customer service Within 14 days of the notice to cancel, at its own cost
              and risk.
          </p>
          <p>
              6.6 The limited right to cancel a contract for the Products does not stop a
              Buyer returning damaged or defective Products. If the Products are damaged
              or defective, the Buyer shall contact the Retailer and the Retailer shall
              either (a) replace the Products that are damaged or defective; or (b)
              refund the amount paid for the Products in question. The

          <p class="pb-5">
              Buyer must contact our customer service promptly after the damage or defect
              is noticed.

              electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard such personal data
              from unauthorised access, loss and disclosure and shall otherwise comply
