          </p>

              3. Lawful use of your personal data
          </h4>
          <p>
              We will only use your personal data where we have a lawful basis to do so.
              The lawful purposes that we rely on under this Privacy Policy are:
          </p>
          <p>
              • consent (where you choose to provide it);
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
              • legitimate interests. When we refer to legitimate interests we mean our
              legitimate business interests in the normal running of our business which
              do not materially impact your rights, freedom or interests.
          </p>
          
          <p>
              If you wish to access and use our website, we shall use your personal data
              to allow you to do so all in accordance with our <a href="/terms_and_conditions">Terms of Use</a>. We
              may contact you as part of the provision of the services with information
              about your account and activities on our website.
          </p>
          <p>
              We may from time to time need to use your personal data to comply with any
              legal obligations, demands or requirements, for example, as part of
              anti-money laundering processes or to protect a third party’s rights,
              property, or safety. If any sums are owed by you to another user following
              the purchase of a product on our site, we shall provide your personal
              details to the other user in order that they can pursue the debt.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5">
              We may also use your personal data for our legitimate interests including
              to improve our services and in connection with, or during negotiations of,
              any merger, sale of assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or
              acquisition of all or a portion of our business by or into another company;
              to deal with any customer services you require; for audit purposes and to
              contact you about changes to this Privacy Policy.

              4. Who do we share your data with?
          </h4>
          <p>
              If you purchase any products from a retailer on our site, we shall provide
              your personal data to that retailer so that they can manage your collection
              and if necessary any returns.
          </p>
          <p>
              For our legitimate interests, we may share your personal data with our
              service providers, sub-contractors and agents that we may appoint to
              perform functions on our behalf and in accordance with our instructions,
              including IT service providers, payment providers, accountants, auditors
              and lawyers.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5">
              We shall provide our service providers, sub-contractors and agents only
              with such of your personal data as they need to provide the service for us
              and if we stop using their services, we shall request that they delete your
              personal data or make it anonymous within their systems.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pb-3">
              5. Where we hold and process your personal data
          </h4>
          <p>
              Some or all of your personal data may be stored or transferred outside of
              the European Economic Area (the EEA) for any reason, including for example,
              if our email server is located in a country outside the EEA or if any of
              our service providers are based outside of the EEA
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5">
              Where your personal data is transferred outside the EEA, it will only be
              transferred to countries that have been identified as providing adequate
              protection for EEA data or to a third party where we have approved transfer
              mechanisms in place to protect your personal data – i.e., by entering into
              the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses, or by ensuring the
              entity is Privacy Shield certified (for transfers to US-based third
              parties).
          </p>
          <h4 class="pb-3">
              6. Security
          </h4>
          <p>
              We shall process your personal data in a manner that ensures appropriate
              security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or
              unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. In
              particular, access is restricted to employees who need to know your
              personal data, and we use appropriate password protection and appropriate
              strong encryption electronic measures within our electronic data management         
              systems.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5">
              However, unfortunately, because of the nature of electronic storage, we
              cannot promise that your personal data or any other data you provide to us
              will always remain secure. If there is a security breach, we will do all
              that we can as soon as we can to stop the breach and minimise the loss of
              any data.
          </p>
         <h4 class="pb-3">
              7. Marketing
          </h4>
          <p>
              You may consent to receive marketing email messages from us about the
              services we offer. You can choose to no longer receive marketing emails
              from us by contacting us or clicking unsubscribe from a marketing email.
              Please note that it may take us a few days to update our records to reflect
              your request.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-5">
              If you ask us to remove you from our marketing list, we shall keep a record
              of your name and email address to ensure that we do not send to you
              marketing information.
          </p>
          <h4 class="pb-3">
              8. Your rights
          </h4>
          <p>
              You have a number of rights under applicable data protection legislation.

              personal data that we hold for you.
          </p>
          <p>
              • Right to rectification: You can require us to correct errors in the
              personal data that we process for you if it is inaccurate, incomplete or
              out of date.
          </p>
          <p>
              • Right to portability: You can request that we transfer your personal data
              to another service provider.
          </p>
          <p>
              • Right to restriction of processing: In certain circumstances, you have
              the right to require that we restrict the processing of your personal
              information.
          </p>
          <p>
              • Right to be forgotten: You also have the right at any time to require
              that we delete the personal data that we hold for you, where it is no
              longer necessary for us to hold it. However, whilst we respect your right
              to be forgotten, we may still retain your personal data in accordance with
              applicable laws.
          </p>
          <p>
              • Right to stop receiving marketing information: You can ask us to stop

              account, if you have one.
          </p>
          <p>
              You may be able to exercise some of these rights within your account on the
              website.
          </p>
          <p>
              We reserve the right to charge an administrative fee if your request in
              relation to your rights is manifestly unfounded or excessive.
          </p>
          
          <p class="pb-5">
              If you have any complaints in relation to this Privacy Policy or otherwise
              in relation to our processing of your personal data, please tell us. We
              shall review and investigate your complaint and try to get back to you
              within a reasonable time. You can also contact the Information
              Commissioner, see www.ico.org.uk or if you are based outside of the United

          </h4>
          <p>
              If any provision of this Privacy Policy is held by a court of competent
              jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then such provision shall be
