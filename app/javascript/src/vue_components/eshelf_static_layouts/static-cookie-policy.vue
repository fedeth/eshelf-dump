            What are cookies?
          </h4>
          <p>
              A cookie is a small text file that may be placed on your computer or mobile
              device when you visit one of our websites. We, and some third-party service
              providers, use cookies on our websites. Some are persistent cookies
              (cookies that remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time) and
              some are session ID cookies (cookies that expire when you close your
              browser).
          </p>
          <p>
              We also use other tracking technologies like web beacons (sometimes called
              “tracking beacons” or “clear gifs”) and local storage. These are tiny
              graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise
              when someone has visited our websites or opened an email that we have sent
              them.
          </p>

          <p>
              We use cookies to collect information, including personal data. To find out
              more about personal data and how we respect your data see our <a href="/privacy_policy">Privacy
              Policy</a>. This document sets out more about the types of cookies we
              use, and why.

              Cookies help us to operate our websites and services, enhance and customise
              your experience across our websites and services, perform analytics and
              deliver advertising and marketing that is relevant to you.

              Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be
              provided on or through our websites and services, such as advertising,

              In the tables below you can see a description of each cookie that we use,
              what it does and when its expires.
          </p>
          <table class="my-3" style="width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="5">

              We also use Google Analytics to monitor how our website is used. Google
              Analytics collects information anonymously and generates reports detailing
              information such as the number of visits to the system, where visitors
              generally came from, how long they stayed on the system, and which pages
              they visited. Google Analytics places several persistent cookies on your
              computer’s hard drive. These do not collect any personal data. If you do
              not agree to this you can disable persistent cookies in your browser. This
              will prevent Google Analytics from logging your visits.
          </p>
         <p class="pb-5">
              We also use social media buttons and/or plugins on this site that allow you
              to connect with your social network in various ways. For these to work the
              relevant social media sites (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn)
              will set cookies through our site which may be used to enhance your profile
              on their site or contribute to the data they hold for various purposes
              outlined in their respective privacy policies.

          </h4>
          <p>
              You can accept or reject cookies by amending your web browser controls. But
              if you choose not to allow the use of cookies, your experience of our

              To change your cookie settings, or if you want to be notified each time a
              cookie is about to be used, you should amend the settings provided in your
